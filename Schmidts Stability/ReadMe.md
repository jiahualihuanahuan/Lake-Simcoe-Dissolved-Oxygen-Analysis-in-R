# Schmidt's Stability index
In the repository, I calculated Schmidt's Stability index for Lake Simcoe.

Schmidt stability, or the resistance to mechanical mixing due to the potential energy inherent in the stratification of the water column.

Schmidt stability was first defined by Schmidt (1928) and later modified by Hutchinson (1957). This stability index was formalized by Idso (1973) to reduce the effects of lake volume on the calculation (resulting in a mixing energy requirement per unit area).
